                    <p3>AI has been developping at a consistently fast rate. In the last 2 years, AI has skyrocketed espicially with the release of <b><a href = "https://chatgpt.com/", target = "_blank">ChatGPT</a></b>, an AI Software which

                        impact on our society. However, AI also has many risks and dangers that could come with it.

                    It seems to me that it is very often difficult for the reader to distinguish between AI and a human-authored text, 
                    rather the two are manifestation of the same spirit, two siblings that were born one to the other. 
                    If you came across a write-up which has been written by AI, you'll find that it will nearly resemble a human's writing in 
                    terms of language used, grammar employed and the writing style. This similarity is because based on large corpus of human written text, 
                    it has learned most of the stylistic and grammatical features. Indeed, there are occasions when one cannot distinguish between a sentence 
                    that was written by a machine and a human. For instance, AI can write interesting stories, or produce effective essays, as well as humans do. 
                    Adapted from the style of human writing the AI can convey emotion, jokes, and even sarcasm. However, even though with the help of AI content can be 
                    produced rather fast and effective, each written work has its flavor rooted in personal experience, true creativity, and individual voice. 
                    That is why human writing is unique and/or arguably more realistic at times. Still, the key point is that it is now possible, given information of 
                    good quality, for a computer to come very close to mimicking the actual human cursing ... It's like a very intelligent living companion who can put 
                    together homework for you or sit with you to write a story. Thus, the analysis of the current state of AI writing proves that technology is already 
                    very developed, and it is becoming more and more similar to human creativity.

                    AI has a huge impact towards essay writing in the modern days. 
                    With the fast revolution of AI software such as ChatGPT, AI has been
                    affecting essay writing across the world. All you need is a a quick message 
                    or a prompt based on your essay topic and voila! You have created an essay,
                    with little to no human intervention. Even with the addition of AI detecting software,
                    there is an easy workaround. Using Humanizers like StealWrither AI or WriteSonic AI,
                    grant you access to easily bypass these AI detectors and make your texts seem
                    100% human written.

                    has always been and will be a crucial part of our lives. Although, the advance of AI brutally contradicts
                    our creative mindset. This is so since AI can easily replace the necessary human input and thought process that 
                    used to spark creativity. Espicially with ongoing updaes that allow AI to discover new information 
                    based on patterns and connections of old information. However, it is important for us to understand
                    the all these aspects aren't certain and may be disproved of.

                    Generally, AI's possible impact against writers is predominately unheard of. Many insist that writing 
                    novels or books requires a human charm or can only be properly made with human intervention. Although, as 
                    many companies keep improving their AI and modeling them to replicate the human mindset. Since books require 
                    large amounts of creativity, this can be a huge roadblock for authors. However, for AI, using their technology 
                    to connect informations, they can easily overcome these roadblocks and create creative stories with minimal 
                    effort and time.

                    work is quite challenging, many even say it's impossible. Many true artists, who don't use AI to produce their work have been against AI artists. In fact, the controversy between AI artists
                    and regular artists has scaled to such a point that artists are telling viewers to not support the art created by these AI artists because they disprove of it. This act has causes many AI artists 
                    to go under the radar by not confirming if their art is AI generated. They refuse to tag their art as such, making the difficulty of spotting the difference an all time high.

                        development of intelligence systems capable of creating art. Refik Anadol primarily works with a wide source of data. This data that he gains is turned into art through machine learning algorithims and AI
                        algorithims, which help him as an artist thrive. These algorithims can learn, dream and make creative pieces of art. Refik Anadol states that "You can let the building learn, let the building dream, 
                        let the building become kind of human. Those are part of my imagination with the built environment." This proves how AI and humans can work together and advance as one in the evolution of modern art.

                AI is something many don't fully comprehend. AI has many dangers that could risk jobs, opportunites and communities. Although, it's important to always
                look at things in a different perspective. AI may seem very dangerous and a huge potential risk to our future. However, AI could also greatly benefit our 
                future if we learn how to use AI to our advantage, set boundaries with it, and use it in a respectful, planned out manner.
